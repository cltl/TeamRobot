      <h2>Robin the VUbot</h2>
      <p>Robin the VUbot is a curious chatbot designed to ask you questions about the topic you are talking about. She has some background knowledge based on Wikipedia pages she has read on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_fiction">AI in fiction</a> and Wikipedia pages that are related to these. </p>
      <h3>How do I talk to Robin?</h3>
      <p>You can just type any text into Robin and she will try to understand what you are talking about. It is not necessary to use capitals or punctuation. In follow-up versions, Robin will be outfitted with a speech recognition module. </p>
      <p>When you talk to Robin she will match your words against her background knowledge and consider asking a question about something you talked about. The questions vary depending on a range of factors, where we use "topic" to stand for the things recognised by Robin in the things you say:
      
        <ul>
      <li>The type of things or topic people talk about, e.g. Robin will ask different questions about Scientists than about Science Fiction characters.</li>
      <li>The surprise factor, i.e. how surprising is it that you talk about this topic.</li>
      <li>The relevance factor, i.e. how important is the topic to the background knowledge.</li>
      <li>The kind of knowledge that Robin has on the topic.</li>
      <li>The confidence of Robin that it interpreted the topic correctly.</li>
      <li>The sentiment expressed by you on the topic mentioned.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>How does Robin understand what I typed?</h3>
      <p>As mentioned, Robin has 'read' parts of Wikipedia. How this works is as follows:
      We first crawled content from Wikipedia starting from the Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI page</a> and the Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_fiction">AI in fiction page</a>. From these pages, we followed the links to other Wikipedia pages and downloaded these as well. The pages were interpreted by the <a href="http://www.newsreader-project.eu/">NewsReader reading machine</a>, which builds a big database of knowledge (KnowledgeStore). This KnowledgeStore contains all entities (people, organisations, places), events (what the entities do) and concepts (other things important to these events). </p>
      <p>To give Robin some more specific information about the interviewees in each episode, we have also taken the names of the interviewees and downloaded relevant research papers written by them from <a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a> which were also interpreted by the NewsReader reading machine and added to the KnowledgeStore.</p> 
      <p>Robin's background knowledge is divided into four different layers:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>layer 0: anything that was mentioned before during a chat session</li>
      <li>layer 1: the topic of today's chat session</li>
      <li>layer 2: the general background knowledge on the topic obtained from e.g. Wikipedia</li>
      <li>layer 3: all other knowledge that is accessible from the Linked Open Data cloud, such as people, places and organisations in general.</li>
      </ul></p>
      
      <p>Our strategy is that any input is first matched against layer 0, then 1, then 2 and ultimately to layer 3. Depending on the degree that topics are mentioned in certain layers, the questions that Robin asks will vary as well.</p>
      
      <p>Robin is still learning so she will make mistakes. The VUbot team is recording your interactions with Robin and analysing them to improve her. All feedback is welcome, so feel free to email <a href="mailto:marieke.van.erp@vu.nl?subject=Feedback Robin the VUbot">the VUbot team</a> your suggestions for improvements.
