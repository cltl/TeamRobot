Objectives. Patient experiences of structured heart failure rehabilitation and their views on the important components of heart
failure services were examined. Methods. Focus groups were conducted with fifteen participants (men, n = 12) attending
one of two heart failure rehabilitation programmes. Sessions were guided by a semistructured interview schedule covering
participants' experiences of the programme, maintenance, and GP role. Focus group transcripts were analysed qualitatively.
Results. Participants indicated that rehabilitation programmes substantially met their needs. Supervised exercise sessions increased
confidence to resume physical activity, while peer-group interaction and supportive medical staff improved morale. However,
once the programme ended, some participants' self-care motivation lapsed, especially maintenance of an exercise routine. Patients
doubted their GPs' ability to help them manage their condition. Conclusion. Structured rehabilitation programmes are effective
in enabling patients to develop lifestyle skills to live with heart failure. However, postrehabilitation maintenance interventions are
necessary to sustain patients' confidence in disease self-management.
1. Introduction
The combined effects of an ageing population and advances
in treatments for acute myocardial infarction have resulted
in heart failure becoming what is known as a silent epidemic
in industrialised nations [1]. Heart failure is associated
with severe symptom burden, functional limitation, and
premature death [2]. Treatment regimens are complex,
and there are many barriers to adherence. Unsurprisingly,
patients often report poor quality of life, high levels of
psychological distress, and difficulties adhering to treatment
regimens.
Heart failure presents a diagnostic and management
challenge as most heart failure patients are older, have
multiple comorbidities, and may be on multiple treatment
regimens. In addition, the signs and symptoms of heart
failure are nonspecific, which can be a barrier to early
diagnosis, essential in preventing disease progression and
reducing hospitalisation. A further complication is that many
patients are never told they have heart failure due to clinician
reluctance to use the term [3].
Heart failure places significant burden on primary and
secondary care services. The direct medical costs of heart
failure treatment constitute from 1% to 2% of total healthcare
expenditures in developed countries [4]. This proportion
exceeds that used by HIV or cancer. A significant part
of this cost is due to high hospital readmission rates. While
hospitalisations for most other cardiovascular conditions
have remained static or decreased over the past number
of decades, hospitalisations for heart failure have increased
threefold [5].
Treatment requires a complex combination of pharmacological
and lifestyle interventions. Changes in lifestyle
and symptom monitoring are important complementary
strategies to pharmacological treatment. Lifestyle changes
include the reduction of salt intake, fluid restriction, alcohol
restriction, and modifying physical activity. Symptom
monitoring is essential to detect deterioration in the patient's
condition, for example increased shortness of breath, weight
gain, and oedema (fluid retention). It includes activities such
as daily weighing to monitor oedema. Taken together, these
treatment regimens can be very demanding on the patient.
2
Structured cardiac rehabilitation plays an essential role in
helping patients adopt new lifestyle practices following
their diagnosis of heart failure. Comprehensive programmes
combining exercise and education have been found to
improve physical status and psychosocial well-being, as
well as reducing hospital readmissions [6]. Developing an
in-depth understanding of the disease in patients is a
fundamental aspect of therapy and essential for adherence to
self-management practices [7].
Neglected in the literature around the subject of heart
failure is a description of the patient's perspective on rehabilitation
programmes. The purpose of this study was to explore
patients' experiences of these programmes, including their
views on the important components of heart failure services,
and to examine their quality of life after rehabilitation.
2. Methods
While much quantitative research seeks to draw conclusions
that can be generalised, qualitative research aims to provide
an insight into the meaning of the everyday experiences of
the participants. To explore the experiences of people living
with heart failure, focus groups [8] were conducted with
fifteen participants attending one of two group heart failure
rehabilitation programmes. Each programme was based in
an acute general hospital (one urban, one rural). Fifteen
participants took part, seven from the rural hospital and
eight from the urban hospital. In the rural hospital all
participants were male and in the urban hospital five of
the eight participants were also male. Other demographic
data was not collected as the researchers wanted participants
to talk openly and honestly about their experiences of the
heart failure service. The heart failure services in both
hospitals were limited in size and other demographic data
was not gathered in order to reassure participants about
confidentiality and anonymity. All participants had been
diagnosed for at least one year. In each hospital patients that
had completed heart failure rehabilitation were approached
by the hospital's heart failure rehabilitation coordinator to
participate in the study. Two focus groups were carried
out, one in each hospital. One researcher facilitated both
focus groups and another researcher co-facilitated the focus
group held in the rural hospital. Sessions were guided
by a semistructured interview schedule, with questions
covering various aspects of the patient's illness experiences
including:
(i) experience of the cardiac rehabilitation programme,
(ii) beliefs about their diagnosis of heart failure,
(iii) maintenance and self-care for their condition, and
(iv) the role of the GP in caring for patients with heart
failure.
The order of questions varied according to participants'
responses and followup questions were used to gain further
detail on the topics. The discussions were flexible and
allowed participants to speak freely of their experiences
living with heart failure and to raise issues important to
Rehabilitation Research and Practice
their lives. The focus groups took place in a quiet room
within both hospitals, and no hospital staff were present
for the duration of the discussion. Each session lasted
approximately one hour and was taped with the participants'
permission.
The focus groups were transcribed verbatim and the
resulting data was qualitatively analysed using content
analysis [9]. This generated a more concise set of emergent
codes. These codes were further examined, and this led the
researcher to identify the major themes that emerged from
the data. One researcher carried out all of the analysis and
interpretation of the transcripts. The study protocol was
approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Royal
College of Surgeons in Ireland.
3. Results
Themes identified from the focus group discussions included
improvements in confidence and morale, difficulties in
maintaining self-care, attitudes to GP services, frustrations
with quality of care in other healthcare settings, coping with
the medication regime, and attitudes to the term “heart
failure”.
4. Experience of Programmes
The programmes bolstered the confidence of participants
by providing a benchmark of their health status. Many
started rehabilitation uncertain of the limits within which
they could safely be physically active and fearful of the
consequences if they exceeded this unknown threshold.
Participants repeatedly mentioned how the monitoring of
their heart rate by the medical staff during the exercise
sessions provided a sense of security.
I thought that maybe this thing will creep up
behind me some day, but having done the course
here, you'd be on a monitor and you saw your
reactions to, you knew what you could do and
what you couldn't do . . .. That settled me down
and I was quite happy then. (Centre A, R4).
It was a great reassurance for me, anyway,
personally, a great confidence booster. And I'm not
afraid to do things now. And I was certainly afraid
before I took the course. (Centre A, R1).
The programme of exercise was a crucial kick-start to
becoming functional and mobile once more.
When I came here first I could hardly lift a cup of
water and, sure, I could pick two big buckets now
and go where I like with them. I'd be very fit now,
I couldn't be much fitter. (Centre A, R7).
The patient-centred approach and the focus on their
needs improved participants' morale and counteracted the
sense of isolation and redundancy that often affects heart
failure patients.
Rehabilitation Research and Practice
You got a real feeling from the staff that they'd do
anything they could for you. It was really about us
and they'd go above and beyond to help you. They
are great, the nurses (Centre B, R4).
The group setting facilitated interaction with peers who
had the same condition, which also lessened feelings of
loneliness and anxiety.
And then when you see other people and start
talking about it, it doesn't seem nearly as bad.
(Centre A, R5).
Many of the participants had felt ill-informed about
their condition prior to attending the programme. They
also lacked knowledge of the tips and tricks that would
have helped them cope and improve their quality of life
generally. Information sessions addressed these knowledge
gaps, helping them to understand their condition and
manage it more successfully.
Well, when I left hospital I was given a leaflet to
read and went through them in a scattered sort of
a way. It was only when I came down here that
they explained it in more detail, important parts
of it. (Centre A, R4).
Just one participant had felt overwhelmed by the amount
of information he received on the programme, particularly
the amount of paper material, although this feeling was not
shared by others.
5. Maintenance
A number of participants had felt somewhat directionless
when the programme ended. Once they became responsible
for their own regulation, it was difficult to remain motivated
to maintain the health-promoting behaviours that they had
developed in the clinic. Some had failed to maintain an
exercise regimen, in particular the participants who had
symptoms of fatigue and breathlessness. Lack of equipment
was partly to blame, but the absence of the discipline of the
programme was also a factor.
I found I missed, the first week I slacked on
everything because I had no place, I had no eleven
o'clock to be up here and two o'clock to be up here.
I kinda just went into a bit of a trough. (Centre A,
R1).
The participants were not unanimous on this point,
however, and some seemed to have coped better with
self-maintenance independently of the programme. These
participants continued to exercise and did not feel the need
for external sources of motivation.
You have to get out and do the bit of walking or
whatever, if you don't do it one day it's always
harder then to do it the next. (Centre B, R2).

6. Improvements
Neither group had any criticism of the programmes,
although in both centres participants suggested that facilities
might be improved and expanded. At present, the facilities
are quite cramped as both programmes are run in a single
room that accommodates both the information sessions and
the exercise equipment. It was suggested that a bigger exercise
room would also enable a greater number of people to benefit
from each programme.
Both groups would have welcomed a programme involving
regular followup to maintain their focus and to reassure
them that their self-management of the condition was
appropriate and effective. Just one participant, who was “in
top form”, didn't feel a need for a refresher programme on
the basis that it would demand a time commitment, and that
he didn't see what extra benefit it would offer.
7. GP Services
Participants seemed disillusioned with their GPs, which
contrasted markedly with the enthusiasm they expressed for
the specialist care and support from the cardiac rehabilitation
staff. They generally lacked a close relationship with their GP
and expressed little faith in their GP's ability to recognise
and effectively meet their needs. One participant spoke of
his GP's unwillingness to take responsibility in managing his
condition:
I got blood tests done . . . with my GP, and he got
the results back and he goes . . ., “. . . I'm not taking
responsibility for you, back to [rehabilitation
facility]”. Since we finished the course, I've been
back in [rehabilitation facility] six times (Centre
A, R4).
In relation to their general health problems (not specifically
heart failure), many felt that GPs treated them in a summary
manner, dispensing prescriptions without investigating
the problem:
You go with a pain or an ache to them and they've
no test much for it, ah sure, give you an aspirin,
give you Difene, give you something else for a week
or a fortnight and come back. That's my main
objection: there should be more serious looking
into, like. (Centre A, R5).
The GP was not seen as the first point of contact for
these patients if a medical need arose. An appointment
might not be available when it was needed. Even if it was,
many participants were not confident that the GP could deal
adequately with the situation and would simply send patients
to hospital as a matter of course. If they needed advice,
participants were much more likely to contact the hospital
that was treating them or the cardiac unit.
But if you have a problem at home, something
went wrong with you, like what happened to me
once, the last place you'd be going to would be to
your GP, you'd go straight to the hospital or to the
heart unit here. (Centre A, R6).
4
The participants were unenthusiastic about the proposal
that GPs might provide heart failure rehabilitation programmes.
They felt that GP surgeries would not have the
space nor the facilities to accommodate a programme. They
also felt more secure doing the programme within a hospital
setting:
They know me here, they know what I've been
through and what I need. He (the GP) doesn't
know the half of it (Centre B, R7).
8. Quality of Care
During the discussion, several participants expressed frustration
at the lack of continuity in their care-for example, the
doctor to whom they were referred not being available when
they attended for appointments, or their regular doctor being
replaced by a locum, who changed their medication, which
did not work. The heart failure programmes contrasted
with this experience of medical treatment. Three or four
nurses ran each programme and were present consistently
when participants attended. This opportunity to build a
relationship with the professionals caring for them was
undoubtedly an important aspect of the programme for
participants. From the interactions and comments made on
the day, it was clear that the patients in both groups and
nursing staff with whom they worked closely shared a very
good rapport.
9. Labelling the Condition “Heart Failure”
One participant expressed his aversion to the term “heart
failure”. The term had a discouraging effect when he was
first diagnosed, and he wished for an alternative. Two other
participants disagreed, however, and believed it had made no
difference to their response to their diagnosis:
It's defeatist, we're failed before we start . . . the
nurse came to me and I in the bed and I wasn't
well at all . . . and she gave me these leaflets, Living
with Heart Failure, and I said, “That's some
motivation, living with heart failure”. (Centre A,
R1).
You still have the condition, you can call it what
you like, you still have the condition. To me, it
doesn't matter. (Centre A, R3).
10. Medication
In both hospitals a pharmacist is available as part of the
multidisciplinary team to give patients advice and answer
any questions that may arise. The pharmacist highlights
the importance of understanding their medication, why it
is prescribed and any side-effects that might arise. No one
expressed having difficulty in maintaining the medication
regimen. Most seemed to have accepted that their condition
demanded a complex medication regimen, although some
expressed exasperation with constant changes to their regimens
and the slowness of new medications to take effect.
Rehabilitation Research and Practice
Participants highlighted the need to be organised and to
maintain a routine with regard to taking their medication:
You just get used to it, you've a certain number
of tablets and you just have to take them. That's
the way it goes. I find the containers great [pill
containers with individual compartments] so
you know what you have to take every day and
when you've already taken it. (Centre B, R5).
One participant seemed baffled about the number of
different medications he needed to take, their purpose, and
their side-effects as described in the medication leaflets.
How, God in heaven, could you be right with all
them yokes, and take the leaflet out of the packet
and read all the side effects, you'd go crazy. So what
do you do? (Centre A, R5).
11. Discussion
This study highlights the importance of formal rehabilitation
for heart failure patients to enable them to cope with
and adjust to the condition. Findings indicate that the
programmes had met the needs of patients, and patients
showed a high degree of satisfaction with the quality of care.
Taking part in a heart failure management programme
was a key element in participants' recovery, helping to
rebuild their confidence to resume the normal activities of
daily life. Prior to participation, the fear surrounding any
physical activity had had a debilitating effect on patients.
In the programme environment, however, participants felt
secure in being active because they were supervised by
professionals. This enabled patients to negotiate and adjust
to the limitations placed upon physical activity by the
condition.
Participants felt that the information sessions had
imparted an understanding of the disease that they had
lacked prior to attending. Knowledge of the condition is a
prerequisite to self-management, and enabling patients to
become expert at managing their condition is a core factor in
reducing the burden of heart failure on health care services.
Whilst participants in this study had received information
about heart failure prior to attending the clinic, it seems that
they had had difficulty in assimilating it.
Attending the rehabilitation clinic improved considerably
the morale of participants in this study. A diagnosis
of heart failure causes fear and worry in patients, and
many experience anxiety and depression [10]; however,
maintaining morale is important to succeed in adhering
to a self-care regimen [11]. Interaction with a peer group,
all of whom had the same condition, enabled participants
to share experiences, counteracting feelings of isolation.
These patients, who had felt “written off ” elsewhere in the
healthcare system and had been frustrated by deficiencies in
care, by contrast felt valued in the rehabilitation programme.
The quality of care in the programme-the support of
medical staff who were friendly and encouraging, combined
with the tailoring of care to their individual needs-restored
their self-esteem.
Rehabilitation Research and Practice
Many heart failure patients do not undertake the recommended
self-care activities, and noncompliance with medication
regimens is common [12]. Participants in the current
study, however, indicated that they took their medication
as prescribed. This level of compliance may be due to
having developed an understanding of their medication in
the course of the programme.
On the other hand, there were signs that patients
neglected self-maintenance in other respects once the programme
ended, in the absence of the supports of the
formal care setting. In particular, some patients failed to
maintain an exercise routine. This was attributed in part
to lack of equipment, which suggests that patients must be
supported to develop physical activity routines that are not
dependent upon the equipment and structured routine of
the formal rehabilitation setting. Regular, moderate daily
activity is recommended for all patients with heart failure
[13] and is required to sustain functional improvements
made when exercise is initiated in heart failure rehabilitation
[14]. Corvera-Tindel et al. [15] examined the predictors of
exercise nonadherence in heart failure patients and found
that patients with longer heart failure duration and increased
number of comorbid conditions were less likely to adhere to
a prescribed exercise regimen. Unlike patients with coronary
artery disease, symptoms of depression and anxiety did not
predict exercise adherence, but lower levels of hostility were
found to predict nonadherence in heart failure patients.
Home-based programmes using cost-effective methods that
do not require specialist equipment, including walking,
have shown some promise amongst heart failure patients
[16]. Evangelista et al. [17] found that through homebased
exercise training with advanced heart failure patients,
adherence to exercise was associated with more favourable
clinical outcomes. There was also a positive dose-response
relationship between the amount of exercise performed and
improvement in functional performance and quality of life.
To facilitate adherence, clearly heart failure rehabilitation
exercise programmes must take into account that exercise
training and prescribed exercise must be feasible for patients
in their own homes or away from the hospital environment.
Lack of motivation, however, was also a factor. A
psychological support as well as a significant social outlet
had been severed, leaving a number of participants feeling
directionless. A need for continued external input was felt
in both groups in order to maintain the health-promoting
behaviours that they had started on the programme. This
finding highlights that the rehabilitation needs of heart
failure patients may differ from those with other cardiac
conditions. Heart failure continues to place considerable selfcare
demands on patients even after a course of rehabilitation,
and voluntary support groups for heart failure are
less common than for other diseases, such as cancer. An
abrupt ending of intervention may not be appropriate for
many of these patients, and the provision of maintenance
programmes that reduce interaction with patients gradually
should be examined.
The postrehabilitation needs of patients in this study
were not being met by GPs. Patients had a low level of
confidence that their GPs had sufficient expertise to manage
5
their heart failure care. However, these misgivings may to
some degree reflect the extent of tailored care provided in
the rehabilitation clinic. A challenge in the future will be
to develop rehabilitation or chronic disease management
services for heart failure that do not undermine the role
of the GP in ongoing management of patients for their
heart failure and other conditions. Guidance regarding the
interface of primary and secondary care is needed to manage
the development of heart failure services.
While the findings of this study are significant it is also
important to note its limitations. The small size of the focus
groups carried out does not allow for statistically significant
generalisation of responses to the greater heart failure patient
population. The fact that patients were recruited by the heart
failure programme coordinator in each hospital and that
participants attended the meeting voluntarily also means
that the participant group may not represent views held by
the wider population of heart failure patients, particularly
patients that did not feel strongly about the program, those
that did not complete the program and patients in poor
health that may have been unable to travel to attend the
focus groups. Also, because of the group nature of the focus
group methodology employed, opinions presented by more
assertive focus group members may have overwhelmed ideas
held by other members of the group, influencing the content
of the data generated.
In conclusion, the information provided here provides
some perspectives from patients living with heart failure.
There is much that they are satisfied with about current service
delivery. Those who were managed through a multidisciplinary
chronic disease management programme tailored
for heart failure were enthusiastic about its contribution to
their quality of care, their quality of life and their self-care
and lifestyle management. The challenge is to make such
opportunities for education and support with heart failure
the norm for the much wider group of heart failure patients
who exist now and will grow in numbers into the future.
